3. Security features are in place (authentication required)
4. Industry configurations are available
5. Manual testing recommended for:
   - Full UI interaction flows
   - Document upload with actual files
   - WebSocket real-time updates
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Admin features with admin@emert.ai account

## Notes:
