Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend compilation

### Authentication & Authorization
Uses Replit's OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication system with session-based user management:

- Passport.js for authentication middleware
- PostgreSQL session storage with connect-pg-simple
- User industry selection during onboarding for workspace customization
- Protected API routes with authentication middleware

### Database Design
Comprehensive schema supporting multi-industry document processing:

- **Users**: Profile information with industry selection and company details
- **Documents**: File metadata, processing status, and extracted content
- **Document Analysis**: AI-generated insights and extracted data
- **Extracted Entities**: Structured entity extraction results
- **Processing Jobs**: Background task tracking and status management
- **Industry Configurations**: Customizable settings per industry
- **Chat Sessions**: Persistent chat sessions for multi-document analysis with document IDs array
- **Chat Messages**: Individual messages linked to chat sessions for conversation history
- **Sessions**: Authentication session management

### Document Processing Pipeline
Multi-stage document processing architecture with intelligent AI routing:

1. **File Upload**: Multer-based file handling with validation and storage
2. **Intelligent Routing System** (October 2024):
   - **Pre-Classification**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes document type, complexity, structure before routing
   - **Priority Cascade**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 → Gemini Native → OpenAI GPT-5 → OCR Vision (last resort)
   - **Smart Fallback**: Only cascades to next AI model on API failures, NOT as default path
   - **No OCR Leaks**: Basic OCR/Vision is absolute last resort, advanced AI models prioritized
3. **AI Text Extraction**: Advanced AI models extract text preserving structure and formatting
4. **Entity Extraction**: Industry-specific data extraction and structuring
5. **Results Storage**: Comprehensive analysis storage with confidence scoring

### Intelligent Router Architecture (October 2024)
Advanced AI-first routing system that eliminates routing leaks to basic OCR:

**Pre-Classification Stage:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes document before processing
- Determines document type, complexity, tables, charts, handwriting
- Recommends optimal processing method based on document characteristics
- Multi-step tool orchestration for dynamic routing to specialized handlers

**Processing Priority (Strict Cascade):**
1. **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Primary - Most Advanced)
   - Complex documents with nuanced content
   - Legal/medical analysis requiring multi-step reasoning
   - Superior accuracy: 95% confidence on complex documents
   
2. **Gemini Native** (Secondary - Speed Optimized)
   - Native PDFs with embedded text layers
   - Fast processing: 10-20 seconds for text-based documents
   - 93% confidence, optimized for structured PDFs
   
3. **OpenAI GPT-5** (Tertiary - Structured Extraction)
   - Structured documents requiring precise entity extraction
   - Good for forms, invoices, financial statements
   - 91% confidence with strong JSON output
   
4. **OCR Vision** (Last Resort Only)
   - Scanned documents without text layers
   - Image-based documents requiring OCR
   - Only used when ALL AI models fail or unavailable

**Fallback Logic:**
- Cascades through AI models on API failures: Claude → Gemini → OpenAI
- OCR Vision only engaged if ALL advanced AI models fail
- No default fallback to OCR (fixes routing leaks)
- Proper error handling with exponential backoff retry logic

### Frontend Architecture
Component-based architecture using modern React patterns:

- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling system
- **State Management**: React Query for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Industry Customization**: Dynamic UI adaptation based on user's selected industry

### Industry-Specific Customization
Platform adapts to different industries through configuration-driven customization:

- **Medical**: HIPAA-compliant processing with clinical entity extraction
- **Legal**: Contract analysis and legal entity recognition
- **Logistics**: Multi-language document support with customs compliance
- **Finance**: Financial entity extraction with fraud detection capabilities
- **General Business**: Versatile processing for common business documents

Each industry has specific document types, processing rules, UI customizations, and compliance requirements defined in the industry configurations system.
