Potential Improvements / Enhancements

Area	Suggested Improvements
User Experience & UI	- Mobile responsiveness: test/fix touch targets, layout breaks, and menu toggle behavior
- Enhance sidebar/floating navigation for smaller screens
- Add or refine loading spinners and skeletons everywhere data loads
- Make industry dashboards visually distinct with unique color schemes
- Show explicit error states and recovery flows for failed document uploads/processes
Frontend Logic	- Optimize state refresh after signup/profile/industry changes (already improved but keep validating for edge cases)
- Add optimistic UI updates for document and chat actions
- Use ErrorBoundary broadly for key flows
- Address any remaining desktop/mobile viewport bugs (manual testing required)
AI & Analytics	- Further modularize AI prompt logicâ€”enable easy swap of models/providers
- Add transparency: "Analyzing with X model" indicators for users
- Track API usage/costs per user/admin dashboard
- Offer confidence scores with every AI extract
Security	- Ensure all API endpoints have strict user-based auth checks
- Add/verify security headers (manual browser check required)
- Test/fix rate limiting on critical endpoints
- Run external vulnerability scans pre-deploy
Performance & Infra	- Batch processing for large/multi-page files
- Lazy load chat/doc history for huge accounts
- Add robust progress and retry logic for long/unstable uploads
- Audit and bump dependencies for security/perf patches
Code Quality/Testing	- Expand test coverage for edge-case doc types/industry flows
- Add integration tests for failed login/signup/auth states
- Test real-time doc/chat flows with simulated network lag
- Expand WebSocket stress testing/scripts
Analytics & Reporting	- Add export and reporting for document analytics and chat history
- Offer admin an overview of usage, active users, API spend, failures, etc.
Onboarding & Docs	- Supply in-app step-by-step guides or videos (especially for new industry features)
- Add tooltips/help docs to UI for advanced features
Miscellaneous	- Consider dark mode support and user personalization
- Enable markdown and attachment support in chat
- Develop basic plugin/export architecture for custom business logic
Summary of Manual Checks Needed:

WebSocket real-time flows (document, chat, notification)

Full mobile device testing for all pages

Verify all new admin/industry flows for both fresh signups and existing users

Next Steps:

Prioritize urgent UI/UX gaps and security hardening before public demo.

Perform a round of cross-device usability testing and patch visible breaks.

Deploy integration tests for real-time/document workflows not covered by unit tests.
