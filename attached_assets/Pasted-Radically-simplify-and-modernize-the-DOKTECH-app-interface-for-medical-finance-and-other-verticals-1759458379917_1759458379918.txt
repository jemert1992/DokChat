Radically simplify and modernize the DOKTECH app interface for medical, finance, and other verticals. Focus on sleek design, intuitive navigation, minimal redundancy, and clear, engaging visual structure. Remove unnecessary buttons, redundant tabs, and make the user flow effortless.

Step-by-step instructions:

Audit & Remove Redundancies

Identify all buttons, navigation tabs, and action points currently in the app.

Remove or consolidate any recurring or duplicate actions. Example: “Upload Documents,” “Bulk Upload,” and “Recent Documents” can be collapsed into a single streamlined upload dashboard with context-aware controls.

Only display features relevant to the current user context (Healthcare Professional, Admin, etc.).

Navigation & Layout Simplification

Replace multi-level tab navigation with a flat sidebar or top navigation bar using modern components: icons+labels, optional tooltips.

Prioritize most-used workflows (dashboard, AI analysis, document upload) with large, clear buttons and declutter less-common actions into a “More” menu or collapsible section.

Use progressive disclosure: Only expose advanced settings (e.g., upload mode, admin controls) when needed.

Modern Visual Style

Adopt a neutral or soft gradient color palette with clear contrast and lots of negative space.

Employ card-based layout for actionable elements (Medical Intelligence, Recent Documents, Document Analytics), SHADOWED cards for status (Ready/Processing/Error).

Use smooth edge radius, large and readable typography (font size 18+ for headings, min 14 for body).

Smart Action Buttons

Design primary actions as floating or fixed-position buttons (“Upload,” “Analyze,” “View Results”). Secondary actions (delete, settings, refresh) should be smaller and unobtrusive.

Group batch actions appropriately (e.g., “Bulk Upload” and “Quick/Comprehensive” analysis selection in one dialog).

Add animated icons or subtle micro-interactions for feedback (button press, file add, analysis ongoing).

Optimized Document Workflow

For recent documents: design a sortable, collapsible list with preview, status badge, and one-click actions (View, Download, Delete, Retry Analysis).

Use filters and search input prominently for fast access to documents.

Only show error notifications when related to user’s action; avoid persistent banners.

Industry Customization

Make industry-specific modules (Medical, Finance, Legal, etc.) dynamically load context-aware features.

Hide/disable irrelevant features per user profile; support swift industry switching (via a minimal dropdown or “Switch Industry” flyout).

User Account & Profile

Mini-profile card in header/sidebar: avatar, role (e.g., Healthcare Professional), quick settings.

Context-sensitive controls only (no extra “Admin” tabs unless explicitly needed).

Compliance & Security UI

Highlight HIPAA, Data Encryption, Audit Trail only where relevant (in settings or compliance dialogs).

Avoid cluttering main UI with compliance badges—keep them in info modals or help pop-ups.

Mobile/Responsive Design

Responsive grid/layout for desktop/tablet/mobile.

Mobile nav should convert to bottom bar or hamburger drawer.

Visual Flow Example for Replit Coders/Design Assistants

Home: Dashboard with headline stats (Accuracy, Time, Docs Processed), minimal upload zone, prominent “Analyze Document” CTA button.

Recent Documents: Collapsible list, status pill, quick actions.

Document Analysis: Modal overlay/result card, suggested next steps, “Download All” batch action.
