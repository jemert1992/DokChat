ere are critical Opus 4.1 code package audit enhancements for your DokChat platform on Replit, prioritized for impact and feasibility :

1. Document Processing Speed & Reliability

Optimize multi-AI pipeline with parallel batch processing for OCR/vision/text extraction.

Add fallback mechanisms for silent API failures to surface errors immediately.

Implement backpressure and retry logic for downstream processing tasks.

Log all extraction confidence scores for debugging and internal benchmarking.

2. Advanced AI/Vision Pipeline

Upgrade to multimodal extraction: combine OCR + vision (tables, diagrams, forms, handwriting) in one unified result.

Fine-tune Gemini and OpenAI models for industry-specific key insight extraction.

Introduce Zod schemas for strict JSON output validation of AI/vision results.

Expand entity detection for PHI, contract, financial, legal terms with location mapping.

3. UI/UX Dashboard Enhancements

Enable instant tab switching and real-time updates for document analysis (via WebSockets).

Show error/warning badges if any API/AI result fails or is blank.

Add highly visible confidence meters for AI and extraction results per section.

Mobile and accessibility improvements: fix meta viewport tags, touch targets, responsive layouts.

4. Error Handling & Observability

Centralize exception reporting with Sentry or similar for frontend and backend.

Provide UI popups/descriptions for user-facing errors during file uploads, OCR, AI calls.

Record all failed/empty analysis instances for admin review.

Add verbose logging for all integration points (API calls, database, AI endpoints).

5. Industry-Specific Feature Completeness

Enhance medical, legal, finance, logistics, real estate pipelines with tailored prompts.

Map all extracted entities to dashboard visual overlays per industry.

Embed regulatory compliance checks for medical/legal/finance uploads.

Add admin controls for re-processing, forced fallback, or uploading sample docs for demo/test.

Immediate Steps:

Restore any failing OCR calls, verify Google Vision API keys, and confirm fallback with plain PDF/text reading.

Push UI changes for error visibility and add badges to dashboard.

Run batch tests per document typeâ€”surface analytics for any industry tab still returning blank or low-confidence text.

Stage demo with sample docs to validate insight tab click-through/UI feedback cycles.

These enhancements position DokChat for robust, demo-ready client use with strong reliability, explainability, and full feature coverage across industries.
